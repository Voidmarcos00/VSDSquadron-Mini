**AS PER THE REQUIREMENT OUTPUT OF GCC (F1) SHOULD BE EQUAL = TO OUTPUT OF RISCV GCC (F2)**

**Step - 1: To Run the code in the normal GCC Compiler**<br>
           <br>**To compile the code: gcc sum1ton.c -o sum1ton**
           <br>**To Get the output use "./a.out" : Here the output finds to be -Sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is 125250**

            
**Step - 2: To Run the code in the RISC-V GCC Compiler**

  <br>**To compile the code: riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -o sum1ton sum1ton.c**
  <br>**To Get the output use "./a.out" : Here the output finds to be -Sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is 125250**
